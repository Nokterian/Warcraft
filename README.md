Adriox UI Ultra Widescreen Profile by Nokterian


This is an Ultra Widescreen UI version of Adriox since his ui is made for 1080p this goes up to 3440x1440p.

I did some adjustments to my leasure but you can always do what you want. I moved the bars so i could see them you can off course turn them off.

Healer UI is a bit the same as his only moved the bars so i could see them, moved some ui parts as well for better clarity.
